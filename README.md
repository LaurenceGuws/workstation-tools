# Workstation Tools

Small bounded Zig workstation operations for agent runtimes and transports.

This package owns execution mechanics and their base schemas. It does not own MCP, HTTP, agent/session identity, conversation state, Activity/Chronicle logging, Fleet topology, authentication, or UI presentation.

Embedding hosts explicitly select where child-process environment comes from through `Policy.environment_source`. The default
`user_manager` source snapshots the current systemd user-manager environment before each process or durable job, which suits
long-lived desktop agents. An isolated host such as a container may instead select `process`, which snapshots the embedding
process environment and still runs the same bounded login-shell environment normalization. The package never guesses between
those environments from filesystem or process-manager availability.
